## Generating draft in preprint mode

The python script `copy-file.py` is creating a copy of the original `.tex` file and it changes the template mode as a `preprint`. The script compiles (using `subprocess` package) both `.tex` files with `pdflatex` (which is locally installed on the machine via the [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) package). After compilation, the script also takes care of cleaning up the remaining files (i.e. `.aux`, `.log` ). 

The script requires permission for execution within the shell.

### RevTex 4.2

The [REVTEX](https://journals.aps.org/revtex#:~:text=To%20install%20REVTeX%204.2%2C%20unzip,the%20texmf%2Dlocal%20directory) package is used for a template that is consistent with the requirements of the APS Journals.
